<h3>Australian's in FIA Formula 3</h3> 
<p>Heading into the final race of the 2024 FIA Formula Three season, I want to shine a little bit of a light on Australia’s two full-time competitors, and FRECA driver James Wharton.</p>

<p>Topping our miniature standings for the three Australians, is Christian Mansell on 97 points. Before the penultimate round in Belgium, the 19-year-old was a contender for the championship. Unfortunately, he’s dropped back going into the final round, but that doesn’t diminish his effort nor pace this season.</p>


<p>I’ll admit, I am biased towards Mansell and actievly support him each race week, but I have good reason. A favourite off-track moment has to be this sweet message on X on August 1st. (place that link to the article here) Mansell’s small gestures are genuine and heart-warming in a way that brings positivity to the world around him. He is a young driver, without the world-wide fame that some people use as an excuse for famous people doing good deeds.</p>


Our second Australian driver is Tommy Smith

 With a little cameo from formula 4 driver James Burton who raced in formula three at the Silverstone Grand Prix. Topping the standings for Australians this year is Christian Mansell 19 year old from NSW currently racing for a Lt Grand Prix. Christian is currently sitting on 97 points meanwhile other full time Australian Tommy Smith is sitting on 12. Which was scored in an impressive P26 topete for race at Silverstone in the feature race at Silverstone during his debut race for formula 3 James wooden did not score any points but I hope to see more points next year
